# Project Setup

This guide outlines the steps to set up your Flask application with Gunicorn for deployment.

## Installation

First, ensure you have Gunicorn installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

After installing, generate a `requirements.txt` file to manage your project's dependencies:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## File Structure

Your main application file should be named `app.py`. Ensure this file contains your Flask application.

### Procfile

Create a `Procfile` in the root of your project to define the command for starting your application. The contents of the `Procfile` should be:

```
web: gunicorn app:app
```

### .gitignore

To prevent unnecessary files from being tracked by Git, create a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:

```
# Created by https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/flask
# Edit at https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore?templates=flask
